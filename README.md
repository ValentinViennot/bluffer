# Bluffer - Remote app

![Screenshots](./design/bluffer-demo.png)

## Abstract
In these times of lockdown, it is critical to stay in touch with our friends and family. What's better for that than a great board game? Unfortunately, some of these games can merely be played remotely. We could hijack our traditional messaging apps. But wouldn't it be funnier to focus on the game?     
The [Bluffer](https://www.trictrac.net/jeu-de-societe/bluffer) is, for us, one of the most user-friendly and fun games to play. However, it's also one of the hardest to virtualize without specific tools.    
Do you have a Bluffer at home? Clone this repository which provides client and server under open source license, launch your favorite video chat application with your friends or family and start playing!

## How to play?

To play this game you need at least 3 players, but the more you are the funnier it is (although you should set a limit at 7-10 players).

6. Wait for everyone to send his fake answer (a green dot appear next to each player avatar once they have sent their answer)

7. If the Master updates your answer you will see a new box where you can accept the changes or edit them. It is usually to merge similar answers or to make yours more likely.
8. You can then proceed to vote for the answer you think is true **do not Google it!**. To acknowledge your vote, you'll see your avatar appear on the button of the answer you selected.
9. The game Master closes the votes. You can now see your points, who wrote which answer and others votes.
